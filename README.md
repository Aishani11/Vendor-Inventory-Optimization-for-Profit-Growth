# Vendor-Inventory-Optimization-for-Profit-Growth
In this project, I analyzed inventory and sales data to identify slow-moving stock, pricing outliers, and vendor concentration risks. Using SQL and Python, I optimized vendor orders, reduced unsold inventory by $2.71M, and improved profit margins by 10â€“15% through targeted promotions and pricing adjustments.
